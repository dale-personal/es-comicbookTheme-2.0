# Overview

This is port of the original comic book theme to the new Emulation Station DE theme engine.

## Variants

There are 2 variants: Classic and Modern.

- Classic should look very much like the original implementation for retropie

- Modern tries out some of the new capabilities in the desktop edition, with a focus on making videos and images more of a focus.
