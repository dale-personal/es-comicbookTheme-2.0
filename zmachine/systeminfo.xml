				The Z-machine is a virtual machine developed by Infocom in 1979 for use with its text adventure games.
				
				The "Z" stands for Zork which was Infocom's first adventure game.
				
				Support for a target platform was implemented by writing a Z-machine interpreter.
				
				This was an important advantage over having to write each games in native code for every architecture due to the abundance of incompatible home computers during this time period.
