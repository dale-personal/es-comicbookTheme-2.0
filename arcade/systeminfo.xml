				An arcade game or coin-op game is a coin-operated entertainment machine.
				
				Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers.
				
				While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s.
				
				Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home video game consoles increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.
